# KickInsights

Background
In the ever-evolving world of football, with enormous passion from millions of fans across the globe, there is a growing demand for convenient yet comprehensive access to football data. Hence, a variety of mobile applications have been developed in the past decade. This project aims to create a mobile app – KickInsights, to further elevate fans’ football experience by tackling the common inefficiencies of current mobile application alternatives and implementing a game-changing match prediction system by leveraging the power of machine learning.

Objectives
KickInsights is a brand-new mobile app that brings comprehensive football data onto mobile devices. Football enthusiasts will no longer need to access in-depth statistics via personal computers, or by going through time-consuming and repetitive navigation on web browsers.
The app also allows users to extract insights from the data provided via interfaces for statistical comparison. To enhance data utilization, an interactive match prediction system has been developed, where users can build, train, evaluate their machine learning models, and even publish them to the app community.

KickInsights
KickInsights is a React Native app built with Expo that provides valuable insights and data for soccer enthusiasts. This guide will walk you through the process of installing Node.js, setting up Expo, and running the KickInsights app on your local machine.

Prerequisites
Before you can run the KickInsights app, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your local machine:

Node.js
Expo CLI
Installation
Node.js
Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that allows you to run JavaScript on the server-side. To install Node.js, follow these steps:

Visit the official Node.js website at https://nodejs.org.

Download the LTS (Long Term Support) version for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).

Run the installer and follow the instructions provided.

Once the installation is complete, open a new terminal or command prompt window and verify that Node.js is installed by running the following command:

shell
Copy
node --version
This should display the version number of Node.js.

Expo CLI
Expo CLI is a command-line tool that allows you to create, develop, and build Expo apps. To install Expo CLI, follow these steps:

Open a terminal or command prompt window.

Run the following command to install Expo CLI globally:

shell
Copy
npm install -g expo-cli
This may require administrator privileges. If you encounter any issues, try running the command with sudo (for macOS and Linux) or run the command prompt as an administrator (for Windows).

Once the installation is complete, verify that Expo CLI is installed by running the following command:

shell
Copy
expo --version
This should display the version number of Expo CLI.

Running the App
To run the KickInsights app on your local machine, follow these steps:

Clone or download the KickInsights repository from GitHub.

Open a terminal or command prompt window and navigate to the project directory.

Install the project dependencies by running the following command:

shell
Copy
npm install
Once the dependencies are installed, start the Expo development server by running the following command:

shell
Copy
expo start
This will start the Expo development server and open a web page in your default browser.

From the Expo web page, you can choose to run the app on a physical device using the Expo Go app or run it on a simulator or emulator. Follow the instructions provided on the Expo web page to launch the app on your desired platform.

Note: If you choose to run the app on a physical device, make sure your device is connected to the same Wi-Fi network as your development machine.

Once the app is running, you can explore the various features and functionalities of KickInsights.

That's it! You've successfully installed Node.js, set up Expo, and run the KickInsights app on your local machine. Enjoy using KickInsights to gain valuable soccer insights and data!
